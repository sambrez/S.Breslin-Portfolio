            <p> Thanks for visiting my profile! My name is Sam, and I am a 28-year-old lifelong New England resident. 
                I grew up in southern New Hampshire but have also resided in MA, RI, and VT over the years. 
                Today, my wife and I have settled back in the seacoast of New Hampshire. 
                I am a huge Boston sports fan and in my free time I enjoy gardening, cooking, fishing, and lounging at the beach! 
            </p>
            <p> I graduated from Pinkerton Academy in 2013 before pursuing higher education at the University of Vermont.
                I eventually transferred to the University of New Hampshire where I earned a bachelor’s degree in Sustainable 
                Agriculture and Food Systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently work as a winemaker and vineyard manager at Zorvino Vineyards in Sandown, NH.
                I am heading into my sixth season in the winery and have truly fallen in love with the industry.
                Viticulture and winemaking are incredibly complex, nuanced, and chemistry driven.
                It has provided me with a multitude of learning opportunities and this field constantly spurs creativity.  
            </p>

                In 2023 I began to pursue an interest in coding and web development and enrolled in UNH’s immersive coding 
                bootcamp. I will be tackling coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as other basic 
                principles of web design and development. So far I am greatly enjoying the challenge that this class 
                provides and am looking forward to pushing myself and all that this course has to offer.
